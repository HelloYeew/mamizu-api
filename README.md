# mamizu-api
 My personal API to make some stuff easier

## Purpost of this project

I want to make my personal API as I want to explore more framework and this API is about my personal project.
So why just not make a API for my personal project? That's it.

## Why this name?

I put this API beside [mamizu](https://github.com/HelloYeew/mamizu) because I don't want to pay more server fee.

## TODO List
