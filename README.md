# mamizu-api
 My personal API to make and develop some personal stuff easier

## Purpost of this project

I want to make my personal API as I want to explore more framework and this API is about my personal project.
So why just not make a API for my personal project? That's it.

## Why this name?

I put this API beside [mamizu](https://github.com/HelloYeew/mamizu) because I don't want to pay more server fee.

## TODO List

- [ ] CRUD operations
- [ ] Can manage CRUD operation on site
- [ ] Documentations
- [ ] Convert to database
- [ ] Convert to TypeScript

## Documentation

*Coming soon*

## Setup the project

Clone this repository to your local machine.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/HelloYeew/mamizu-api
```

Install dependencies.

```shell
npm install
```

Create the new `.env` file for configuration.

```dotenv
DEBUG=true # If true it will include debug information and debug URL route
PORT=3000 # Port number
```

Start the development server

```shell
npm start
```

And the server will run on port 3001.

Note : On `npm start` it will use nodemon to run the server for easier debugging since it will restart the server when there is any change.
